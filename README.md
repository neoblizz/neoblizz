### :wave: Hi.
Meet me, **Muhammad Osama**. I intend to use this page as means to document what I have done so far in the academic world. Somehow, from the cloudy-gloomy weather of **University of Washington, Seattle**, where I got my Bachelor's of Electrical Engineering from, I ended up in the ever-so-sunny California. I am currently a *Ph.D. student* at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at **University of California, Davis**, working with **Professor John Owens** and other brilliant students on some really cool stuff — keep reading to find out more!

### :books: Let's add some structure. (wip)
I have catagorized my academic and general contributions into three parts:

1. **Research Projects** — Ph.D. works and important research contributions.
    - [Gunrock, GPU Graph Analytics](https://github.com/neoblizz/neoblizz/wiki/Gunrock)
    - [GPU Load-Balancing](https://github.com/neoblizz/neoblizz/wiki/Load-balancing)
3. [**Everything else**](https://github.com/neoblizz?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=&sort=) — Some research, some fun stuff.
4. **Future Projects** — Projects I have planned for the future.
