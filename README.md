## :wave: Hi.
Meet me, **Muhammad Osama**. I intend to use this page as means to document what I have done so far in the academic world. Somehow, from the cloudy-gloomy weather of **University of Washington, Seattle**, where I got my Bachelor's of Electrical Engineering from, I ended up in the ever-so-sunny California. I am currently a *Ph.D. student* at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at **University of California, Davis**, working with **Professor John Owens** and other brilliant students on some really cool stuff — keep reading to find out more!

*A quick note, as I have limited time, I don't intend to keep everything updated all the time, so if you have any questions drop me a note at mosama@ucdavis.edu — I would love to chat about anything research related.*

## :books: Let's add some structure.
(because without it, it's chaos) I have sectioned my academic work into three parts:

1. **Research Projects** — these are the projects that I have worked on during my Ph.D. and are important research contributions.
2. **Everything else** — these are the projects that are not so much research-y, but interesting to me and/or were fun to do. So, basically, whatever I didn't classify as research can be found here.
3. **Future Projects** — this section is moreso for me, things that I find interesting and would like to do at some point in my life.
